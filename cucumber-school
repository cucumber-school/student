This tool will set you up ready to follow along with the conding examples from the Cucumber School video series.

We keep all the code for the videos in git, we're going to get you  to the starting-point for
any chapter in the series, so you can follow along on your own machine.

It will create a folder below $(pwd) so make sure you're in the right directory before you start.
